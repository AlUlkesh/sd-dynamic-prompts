# This is a placeholder for another great collection of wildcards which you can find here: https://github.com/devilkkw/StableDiffusion/tree/main/wildcards

You can install it with these commands from within the main auto1111 directory (on Linux - on windows you might need to change `mv` to `move`)

```
git clone https://github.com/devilkkw/StableDiffusion/ extensions/sd-dynamic-prompting/wildcards/devikkw/
mv extensions/sd-dynamic-prompts/wildcards/devikkw/wildcards/* extensions/sd-dynamic-prompts/wildcards/devikkw 
```
