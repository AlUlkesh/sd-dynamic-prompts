0.1 Initial implementation
0.2 Fixed Batch img2img implementation
0.3 Added interval implementation for combinations, i.e. you can now use {1-2$$op1|opt2|opt3} which will choose one or two options

0.4.2 Ignoring unknown characters in non-utf8 encoding wildcard files
0.4.3 Printing prompts at logger level INFO
